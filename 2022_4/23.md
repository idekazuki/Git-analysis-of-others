Today, I bought a pants because I got a mina points.

Maina points is a degital money gifted by japanise gorvoment.

All japanese people can get a mina points by get the my number card.

My number card is Japanese People's id card. If you have it, you can pay tax on web site.

Today I bought pants because I earned miner points.

Miner points are electronic money given by the Japanese government.

All Japanese citizens can get it if they apply for a my number card.

My number card is used to identify Japanese citizens and if you have it , you can pay your texes online.
