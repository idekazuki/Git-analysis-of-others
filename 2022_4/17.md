Today, Sasaki roki played perfect pitch in baseball game .

But he stop playing at 9th game and his team was lose.

I'm not interesting in base ball, but recentry feel fun in baseball because of Ohtani and sasaki.

Roki Sasaki pitched a scoreless inning today.

However, he gave up in 9th inning and his team ended up losing.

I am not interested in baseball, but recently I have beeen looking forward to it a lettle because of Otani and Sasaki.
